                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Kurukshetra isn't just a spiritual capital; it's a massive education hub in Haryana. With thousands
                    of students flocking to <strong>Kurukshetra University (KUK)</strong> and nearby schools,
                    competition is fierce. Whether you are preparing for board exams or competitive tests, knowing your
                    city is key to success.</p>

                <h2>1. Kurukshetra University (KUK): The Heart of Education</h2>
                <p>KUK is one of India's premier universities. For school students in Kurukshetra, the university sets
                    the academic tone.
                    <br><strong>Tip:</strong> The <em>Jawaharlal Nehru Library</em> on campus is a legendary spot for
                    serious study sessions, but did you know you don't need to go that far? If you live in <strong>Didar
                        Nagar</strong>, you have access to expert guidance right next door at Unnat Tuition Center.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Geeta Jayanti: More Than Just a Festival</h2>
                <p>Every year, the <strong>International Geeta Jayanti Mahotsav</strong> transforms Brahma Sarovar into
                    a spectacle of culture and wisdom. For students, this is a great time to disconnect from stress and
                    reconnect with heritage. The teachings of the Gita are all about <em>Action (Karma)</em>—exactly
                    what you need for your exam prep!</p>
                <blockquote>"You have the right to work, but for the work's sake only. You have no right to the fruits
                    of work." - This applies perfectly to your studies. Focus on the preparation, and the marks will
                    follow.</blockquote>

                <h2>3. Best Places for Coaching & Tuition</h2>
                <p>While Sector 17 and KUK campus are popular, time is money for a student. Traveling hours for coaching
                    drains your energy.
                    <br><strong>Didar Nagar</strong> has emerged as a prime residential hub for students. Located here,
                    <strong>Unnat Tuition Center</strong> offers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Save travel time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Attention:</strong> Unlike overcrowding in big centers.</li>
                    <li><strong>All-Round Growth:</strong> From Class 1st basics to Spoken English mastery.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Surviving Exam Season</h2>
                <p>When the date sheet arrives, panic often follows. Here is a quick survival strategy:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Plan Early:</strong> Don't leave syllabus for the last month.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mock Tests:</strong> We conduct weekly tests at Unnat to remove exam fear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay Healthy:</strong> Take walks at the scenic Brahma Sarovar to de-stress.</li>
                </ol>
